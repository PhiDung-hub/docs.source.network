# Collections

Each and every developer-defined type is attached to a `Collection`. A `Collection` is similar to a SQL Table, which represents a group of documents with similar structures.

Each collection gets an auto-generated query field, allowing users and developers to query, filter, select, and interact with documents in several different ways.
