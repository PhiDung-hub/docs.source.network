# Collections

A **collection** is analogous to a SQL table, representing a group of documents with similar structures. Every developer-defined type is associated with a collection.

Each collection receives an automatically generated query field, enabling users and developers to query, filter, select, and interact with documents in various ways. This allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation within the collection.
