# IPFS

## Overview

IPFS is a decentralized system to access websites, applications, files, and data using content addressing. IPFS stands for **InterPlanetary File System**.

## Key Features

- Distributed/decentralized system
- Uses content addressing
- Participation

A decentralized system lets you access information or a file from multiple locations, which aren't managed by a single organization. The pro's of decentralization are - access to multiple locations to access data, easy to dodge content censorship, and faster file transfer.

## How Does it Work?

As discussed earlier, IPFS is a p2p (peer-to-peer) storage network. The IPFS ecosystem works with the following fundamental principles.

1. Unique identification via content addressing
2. Content linking via directed acrylic graphs (DAGs)
3. Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs)
