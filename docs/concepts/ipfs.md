## Overview

IPFS, or **InterPlanetary File System**, is a decentralized system designed for accessing websites, applications, files, and data using content addressing. This technology aims to revolutionize the way networks of people and computers exchange information with each other.

## Key Features

- Decentralized system
- Content addressing
- Active participation

Decentralization allows users to access information or files from multiple locations, which are not controlled by a single entity. The benefits of decentralization include multiple data access points, resistance to content censorship, and faster file transfers.

IPFS identifies files by their content instead of their location. A content identifier is the cryptographic hash of the content at that address, unique to the content it represents, and enables users to verify they have received the requested information.

For IPFS to function effectively, active participation of users is essential. Sharing files via IPFS requires having copies of the shared files available on multiple computers, which must be powered on and running IPFS. In essence, participants provide access to each other's files and contribute to their availability when requested. By default, when you download a file using IPFS, your computer will share it with other participants.

## How Does it Work?

IPFS operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) storage network, utilizing the following core principles:

1. Unique identification through content addressing
2. Content linking using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
3. Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs)
