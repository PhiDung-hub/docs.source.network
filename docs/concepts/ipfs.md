# IPFS

## Overview

IPFS is a decentralized system to access websites, applications, files, and data using content addressing. IPFS stands for **InterPlanetary File System**.

## Key Features

- Distributed/decentralized system
- Uses content addressing
- Participation

A decentralized system lets you access information or a file from multiple locations, which aren't managed by a single organization. The pro's of decentralization are - access to multiple locations to access data, easy to dodge content censorship, and faster file transfer.

IPFS addresses a file by its content instead of its location. A content identifier is the cyrpto hash of the 

The content identifier is a cryptographic hash of the content at that address. The hash is unique to the content that it came from, even though it may look short compared to the original content. It also allows you to verify that you got what you asked for.

## How Does it Work?

As discussed earlier, IPFS is a p2p (peer-to-peer) storage network. The IPFS ecosystem works with the following fundamental principles.

1. Unique identification via content addressing
2. Content linking via directed acrylic graphs (DAGs)
3. Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs)
